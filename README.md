# My own personal website!!

This repo contains all of the code used on my personal website!

## [The Website!](https://ikerurle-personal-website.herokuapp.com/)

### Why are you building a personal website? 

1. I want to learn how to create, mantain and deploy a complex website.
2. The web may be useful as a portfolio.
3. I am doing the [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/ikerUrle/100-days-of-code) challenge and I'm already out of ideas :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: .

### What are you using to build it?

In terms of languages, I'm using `HTML`, `JS` and `SASS` right now. The goal is to create the website without depending on bigger frameworks (like Angular, React...), but I want to learn how to use them as well so I may re-write everything again.  

### Deployment 
Right now, the website is completely Front-End oriented but I am using `node.js` and `express` as backend to deploy the app on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
